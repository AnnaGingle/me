                        TurboTax was helpful in analyzing already existing conversational interfaces out in the market. It is already used by Americans dealing with government taxes and other financial problems. This link between a government issue and a brand making an interface that has ease of use is something we sought out to replicate. They have already tackled the problem of writing legal jargon in a capacity for the average user to understand. We pulled both interactive design and content writing as inspiration for Veer.

                Young adults are constantly finding new ways to learn outside the classroom. The growing accessibility of information online motivates independent learning.<br>
                Studies show that students feel that school is uninteresting. The top reason being it does not cover topics that don't relate to their future ambitions<br>
                Many students are disengaged the moment they enter those classroom doors.

            Duolingo pitches their service as a hobby, albeit a productive one. Voting, however, is a civic duty and part of our user indoctrination is to emphasize the importance of voting behaviors in the United States.
