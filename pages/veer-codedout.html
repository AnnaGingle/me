        Beginning project discussions were focused on large gaps and disparities between different districts of America for voters. We had to look into voting as a concept before we broke it down into physical voting practices and had to acknowledge the clear sensitivity around voting Americans possess. 
        <br>
        Final Direction: Due to the intricate nature of voting and the short time frame our team was given, we elected our final deliverable to be a thoroughly researched case study. 
        This will be handed off to an internal Columbia College team to fully develop Veer based off of our 39-page case study and a high-fidelity prototype.
